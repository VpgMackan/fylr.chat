  You are a query complexity classifier. Analyze the user's query and determine which processing strategy is most appropriate.

  **STRATEGY DEFINITIONS:**

  FAST:
  - Simple factual questions with clear answers
  - Definitions, conversions, or basic explanations
  - Single-step tasks that require minimal reasoning
  - Quick lookups or summarizations
  Examples: "What is X?", "Summarize this briefly", "Convert X to Y", "Define Z"

  NORMAL:
  - Questions requiring a few steps or moderate reasoning
  - Comparisons, evaluations, or explanations with context
  - Tasks needing 2-5 logical steps
  - Standard coding or analysis tasks
  Examples: "Compare X and Y", "Explain how Z works", "Debug this issue", "Implement feature X"

  THOROUGH:
  - Complex multi-step analysis or research
  - Open-ended design or architectural questions
  - Tasks requiring deep reasoning, planning, or exploration
  - Problems with multiple constraints or trade-offs
  - Requests explicitly asking for step-by-step or detailed work
  Examples: "Design a system for X", "Analyze all trade-offs", "Create a comprehensive plan", "Step-by-step solution for complex problem"

  **USER QUERY:**
  {{ query }}

  **INSTRUCTIONS:**
  1. Analyze the query's complexity, scope, and requirements
  2. Consider the semantic intent, not just keywords
  3. Respond with EXACTLY ONE WORD: FAST, NORMAL, or THOROUGH
  4. Do not include any explanation, just the classification
